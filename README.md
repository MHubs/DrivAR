DrivAR
======================
We're improving driving for the common good. With AR we can help everyone drive safe in a new fun way! DrivAR is designed with the driver in mind and aims for a nearly hands-free experience for people all around the world.

:star: Leave a star if you like the project!

## Motivation
I'm a very nervous driver and I always go down wrong turns or make rash decisions. I wanted to make an app that could help me become a safer and more confident driver. Many navigation apps aren't user friendly and seem very clunky so I wanted to make an app that's accessible for all users and is sleek and streamlined. After some research, I decided that Augmented Reality could become my solution.
